You can\n        browse through the many <strong>subreddits</strong> in philosophy, languages, coding, molecular gastronomy or whatever makes your mind\n        hungry.\n        However, being the great source of information it is, Reddit <strong>lacks</strong> when it comes to the organisation of all this data.\n        Reddit has all its data organised into Subreddits and people explore reddit through these subreddits only. Reddit does\n        not have a proper feature to search by relevance.\n        Moreover, adblock and other extensions cause further issues with the current search facility available.\n\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footer-copyright text-center py-3\">\n        <p>Made by Vedant, Hamza, Hrishit.</p>\n    </div>\n    \n</body>\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"73387206915b8d4d05939fdb4e38c9e4","cacheData":{}}

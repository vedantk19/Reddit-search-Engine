        As we said earlier, <strong>Reddit</strong> is an incredible source of information on pretty much every field of human knowledge. You can
        browse through the many <strong>subreddits</strong> in philosophy, languages, coding, molecular gastronomy or whatever makes your mind
        hungry.
        However, being the great source of information it is, Reddit <strong>lacks</strong> when it comes to the organisation of all this data.
        Reddit has all its data organised into Subreddits and people explore reddit through these subreddits only. Reddit does
        not have a proper feature to search by relevance.
        Moreover, adblock and other extensions cause further issues with the current search facility available.
